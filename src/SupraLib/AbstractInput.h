	/**
	 * The base class for all input nodes.
	 *
	 * An input node has no input ports on its own, but maintains at least one output port.
	 * The input nodes are the source of the dataflow. As such they are not restricted in
	 * when they are active. 
	 * There are three major threading modes for input nodes. These are described schematically
	 * in sequence diagrams in the Visual Studio models in doc/models_supra.
	 * 1. Callback driven
	 *		If the implementation receives the data via callbacks from some other interface,
	 *		it can simply put the data into the dataflow graph (\see addData) from within the 
	 *		callback
	 * 2. Polling
	 *		Once the input node is started (\see startAcquisition), the implementation is run in
	 *		its own thread. As such it can poll an device for new datasets. Yielding that thread
	 *		via sleeping can also be performed as deemed fit.
	 * 3. Timer based
	 *		For simple inputs a timer-callback can be sufficient. For that a timer is implemented
	 *		within input nodes (\see SingleThreadTimer). It is configured with the method 
	 *		\see setupTimer and once \see timerLoop is entered, the timer continously calls 
	 *		\see timerCallback for the node, sleeping appropriately inbetween calls.
